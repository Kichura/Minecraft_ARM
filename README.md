# Minecraft (ARM Support)

An experimental MultiMC instance for trying to add ARM support to Minecraft such as M1 devices. No mods will be included except latest snapshot available.

*(This project is not meant for full reproduction as it can contain bugs/glitches, If you are sensitive to these kinds of issues; Please don't use this modpack unless you know any better!)*

## Requirements
A [newer java version](https://jdk.java.net/18) is required for ARM devices,
LWJGL [3.3.0](https://pastebin.com/raw/YUiiZY8J) is required for ARM devices and 
Minecraft 1.16.5 or newer is required for both to work as 1.8.9 does not make use of them + LWJGL 3.2.3 only has Linux-ARM64 support.

## Installing the modpack

1. [**Click here to download the modpack**](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM/archive/refs/heads/Trunk.zip),
2. Drag the ZIP into the MultiMC window,
3. Make sure the installed instance has Java 16 or greater installed.

## Disclaimer

While this modpack claims to do what it says on the tin, it is very experimental and can lead to problems unless you know what you are doing then feel free to test it out for yourself; otherwise don't do this at all.
