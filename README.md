# Minecraft (ARM Support)

An experimental MultiMC instance for trying to add ARM support to Minecraft such as M1 devices. No mods will be included except latest snapshot available.

*(This project is not meant for full reproduction as it can contain bugs/glitches, If you are sensitive to these kinds of issues; Please don't use this modpack unless you know any better!)*

## Requirements
A [newer java version](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#download-openjdk) is required for ARM devices,
LWJGL [3.3.0](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM/raw/Trunk/patches/org.lwjgl3.json) is required for ARM devices and 
Minecraft 1.16.5 or newer is required for both to work as 1.8.9 does not make use of them + LWJGL 3.2.3 only has Linux-ARM64 support.

## Installing the modpack

1. [**Click here to download the modpack**](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM/archive/refs/heads/Trunk.zip),
2. Drag the ZIP into the MultiMC window,
3. Make sure the installed instance has Java 16 or greater installed.
