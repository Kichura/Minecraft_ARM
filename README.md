# Minecraft (ARM Support)

An experimental MultiMC modpack that attempts to add ARM support to Minecraft such as M1 devices and Raspberry Pis. No mods will be included except latest release available.

## Requirements
A [newer java version](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-18-sts&package=jdk) is required for ARM devices including [LWJGL 3.3.1](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM/raw/Trunk/patches/org.lwjgl3.json),

and Minecraft 1.14 atleast is required aswell for both to work as 1.8.9 - 1.13.2 do not make use of them and LWJGL 3.2.2 lacks ARM support entirely.

## Installing the modpack

1. [**Click here to download the modpack**](https://github.com/Kichura/Minecraft_ARM/archive/refs/heads/Trunk.zip),
2. Drag the ZIP into the MultiMC window,
3. Make sure the installed instance has Java 17 or greater installed.
